Notes for 4/2/19 meeting
Alan idea to do 

TO DO 
1) create a final dataset
    1. design what we are predicting - I think players fantasy score they got for that period
    1. apply the fantasy formula to data so we can get labels
    1. drop the fantasy formula equations since new games wont have it 
    1. drop all features that we wont have when getting new data
    1. establish a baseine featrue set and baseline model 
    
disc:
we are want obsersavtions as players 
use -standings. 
merge standings and box score. each player attached to that row
    
    
2) split data to a test set and hide that away

3) create features
    
    ideas:
    - if player is the categorized as really good, since teams perfromance is affected by one person 
    - use players height
    - age
    - points 
    - away/home 
    
    
    a) establish a baseline modeline and validation loss.
    b) create visualizations 
    c) do statistical analysis to see what is important
    
4) Establish scaleable and easy to use ML pipeline to evaluate data.

    idea.
